A* Algorithm is a search Algorithm.
There is space of possiblities and you wanna for
a particular element.
There are many solution possible but you wanna have a 
optimum solution of all possible solutions.
This algorithm is applied to path finding type
problem.
Shortest Path to the destination(Fatest Path).
Dijkstra is not super efficient.
A* star is similar to Dijkstra
But it uses a concept of heuristics(educated Guessing)
Intead of checking of every single route.
Here can we make a guess.
So by using this we stop looking to most of the possiblities.
This make a algorithm much faster.

f(n) = g(n) + h(n)

h(n): heuristics
f(n): cost function
g(n):actual cost from beginning to end
